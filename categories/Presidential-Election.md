## Pollster + Aggregation Sources

Our work is, in itself, an aggregation. Most of our data stems from outside organizations known as **pollster aggregations**, which compile polls, studies, and surveys and weight them for accuracy to provide us with graphics and easy-to-understand visuals to help us to conceptualize important pieces of political data, such as public opinion on political figures and legislation, candidate head-to-head matchups, and sources of public support for certain things in certain places. These are some of the most important aggregations that we feel are the most helpful for us.
